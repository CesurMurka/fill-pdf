# fill-pdf
This Jupyter notebook .ipynb fills automatically custom .PDF file with data from Google Drive Sheets. 

It is running on Google Colaboratory https://colab.research.google.com/ . 

This specific notebook works only for our use case, but it is nice to see the connection of Google Collaboratory, Google Drive Folder and Google Drive Sheets. 






FYI, if you are interested: 
This .pdf file contains 60 empty boxes. These boxes are filled from the Google Drive sheets. The boxes represents the radiation dose in Grays. 
TSEI (total skin electron irradiation) technique was used for skin treatment.

We measured this dose from the 60 TLD (thermoluminiscent dosimeters), which were sticked on the patient during the treatment on linear accelerator.
